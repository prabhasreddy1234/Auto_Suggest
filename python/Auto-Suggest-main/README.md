It has two files main.cpp and test5.cpp, where as both has the same code for problem statment. I have used Dev c++ code editor to solve these.
In main.cpp, we used trie data strucures to store a set of word in a simple and efficiency way.
in test5.cpp, wee used a normal way of solving problem to store the set of words.
